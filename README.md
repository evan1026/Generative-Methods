## What are three adjectives that describe your page's desired look?
minimalistic, responsive, configurable

## Find 2-3 websites that have that look, and link them here
* [The GitHub Home Page](https://github.com/) once you are logged in was probably the main inspiration. I wanted something simple which - most importantly - had different available themes for people who prefer light vs dark browsing.
* [The Example A2 Site](https://galaxykate-a2.glitch.me/) was my inspiration for the feel of the main content - the minimalistic design with cards that each show a single item in a list.


## What is one thing you want to be able to build after taking this class?

I enjoy game development, although I haven't done much with it. It would be cool to take principles from this
class and perhaps build some kind of game around them.
