## **Generator 1:** what does this generate?
Some triangles with different colors, sizes, rotations, and borders.

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?
They are just triangles so not a whole lot of interesting things but you can make
them look like other things sometimes.

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this
1. Hue - controls the hue
2. Lightness - controls the lightness
3. Width - controls the width
4. Height - controls the height
5. Border - controls the thickness of the border


## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?
1. Fir Tree - a tall green triangle kind of similar to a fir tree
2. Dorito - An equilateral orange trianle that sort of looks like a chip
3. Right Arrow - Could be used as an arrow that points to the right
4. Left Arrow - Like #3 but points left
5. Piece of Confetti - A tiny triangle that kind of resembles confetti

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?
You can't control the saturation because I felt like that was too many color controls.
It can't make anything but triangles.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?
It was very simple just to get used to the generator framework. Not much more than
a single call to p5. The hardest part was getting the rotation working without it
going off screen.

## **Generator 2:** what does this generate?
Cats.

## What are the most important and interesting qualities of this kind of thing?
Cats have lots of different faces and patterns and colors that make each one unique

## List your 5+ sliders. Describe what each one controls, and why that is relevant to this
1. Fur Saturation - Controls the saturation of the fur color (hue is fixed at orange)
2. Fur Lightness - Controls the lightness of the fur color
3. Eye Color - Controls the color of the iris
4. Pupil - Controls the size of the pupil
5. Whisker Color - Controls the color (really the lightness) of the whiskers

## List your 5+ landmarks. How are they different from each other?
The landmarks are Nutmeg, Autumn, Winter, Pepper, and Sammy. They are all designed to resemble
cats that I have known as closely as possible given that I have no way of adding patterns.

## For a generator of this type of thing, what kinds of things *can't* it generate?
The cats can't have patterns on their fur, only solid colors. Also things like the shape
of the face, the position of the eyes, nose and mouth, and the size and shape of the ears are fixed.

## What was hard or easy about making this generator? How did your plans change?
It was mostly a matter of lining things up. I wanted to add more controls to change the way the face was
layed out but I felt it was too much to deal with for the user.

## Which generator has a more interesting possibility space?
Definitely the cats. The triangles one is fairly boring.
