## What do you want the user to feel when using these tools? What mood is this for? What is the user trying to do?
I want the user to play around with the tools and see what kind of fun
things they can make. The idea is to create the feeling of a sandbox
which gives you very simple things to play with and you can experiment
for a bit.

## Describe your eraser. What does it do?
It draws white lines with a thickness based on the brush size. It also draws
a circle so the user can see where they are going to erase

## Describe your 1st tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The first tool draws cicles with color1 as the border and color2 as
the fill. The thickness of the border is determined by the brush size.
The user starts a drag where they want the center of the circle to be
and drags outward to choose the radius.

## Describe your 2nd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The second tool creates a connected shape with a fill that
the user creates by dragging the mouse.

## Describe your 3rd tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The third tool is a firecracker brush that constantly spawns fire particles
wherever the mouse is as long as the mouse is held down. The fire particles
will fall and decay over time.

## Describe your 4th tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The fourth tool is a symmetric drawing tool that uses color1 and the brush
size to style the lines that are drawn by dragging the mouse.

## Describe your 5th tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The fifth tool spawns alien and robot emoji which grow as the user continues to
hold down the mouse button.

## Describe your 6th tool. What does it do? How is it used?
The sixth tool makes trees. The angle of the branches can be controlled with the brush size slider.

## Which of your tools is continuous? What makes that different?
The second and fourth tools are continuous, and most of the other tools use continuous principles
as well. They all in some way keep track of the previous point and draw a line between the points
rather than drawing discrete shapes.

## Which of your tools uses begin/endshape? What are you doing with that feature?
The second tool uses it. I use it to create a continuous curve which has a fill color
within the bounds of the curve.
